# Ocean-Data-Comparison
Hello! I am an engineering student and a beginner with coding in Python. For this specific project, the code will read data from a specific column, find the average of that column, and then output a line chart of all the data points as well as the average line of that data. I have chosen to use two files from https://portal.aodn.org.au/search, which is ocean data from the coasts of Australia. I wanted to compare data, specifically the temperature and salinity from the West and East coasts and find any differences between them.

If you wish to find the exact .csv files I used for the data, you can find them by navigating to the CTD data selection on the website above, and look for the site code: NRSROT and cruise_id: 3019 for the west coast data and site code: SYD140 and cruise_id: SYD140_046  for the east coast data.
