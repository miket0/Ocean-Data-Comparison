# Ocean-Data-Comparison
Hello! I am an engineering student and a beginner with coding in Python. For this specific project, the code will read data from a specific column, find the average of that column, and then output a line chart of all the data points as well as the average line of that data. I have chosen to use two files from https://portal.aodn.org.au/search, which is ocean data from the coasts of Australia. I wanted to compare data, specifically the temperature and salinity from the West and East coasts and find any differences between them.

If you wish to find the exact .csv files I used for the data, you can find them by navigating to the CTD data selection on the website above, and look for the following info below.

West Coast Data
site code: NRSROT
cruise_id: 3019 

East Coast Data
site code: SYD140 
cruise_id: SYD140_046
